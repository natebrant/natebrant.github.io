// TODO : Front end
Think of a name for the website
Hide password while typing it 
Eventually: add a sidebar on server that will show users online 

//TODO: back end
Make it so that if someone is not logged in it will go to the login page 
Show users online state if they are online with the server faved 
Maybe: find a way to say user is typing

Person class{
this.favorits [] 
This.name
This.password
This.uname
This.online /make it changeable by user but should add a way to check in they are online auto
This.role /mod or user mods will have command that can use in any server
this . color used to pick the chat color if mod or chat set
}
Server class{
This.dir / used to get link to this page
This.limit / set the limit to amount of people that can join this server
this.users[] / a list of people with this page favorited also to be used to say how many people are joined by using .length/size
this.chat [] /saves an array of the chat / not sure if this is the way ill update or no though
Public serverupdate(String chat){
Will go to firebase and append chat to the firebase then update it for all users
}
}
